Well, if you've been reading the news recently all sorts of different attacks and data breaches are happening every day. At any point down the wire your data could be exposed, altered or stolen. The various technologies that come under this domain are as follows: Identity and Access Management like Microsoft Active Directory, IBM Tivoli, Oracle Identity Management, PING , Threat / Vunerability Assessment, Monitoring and Management, SPAM, Virus, Pishing and other Malware Control and Cleanup Activities and other security related issues. Edge Security at the Transaction Level is also a very important aspect of businesses like HTTPS, AS2, Digital Certificate Management, Cloud Application Identity Integration with Enterprise Identity Management and other aspects being part of this major space. Single SignOn and other aspects of Application Authentication, Authorization and Auditing(AAA) are major concerns of an Enterprise. Apart from this the aspect of Data Security on premise as well as Data Security in Mobile Application is another area that we all need to think about as Enterprise Software Developers.</p>
